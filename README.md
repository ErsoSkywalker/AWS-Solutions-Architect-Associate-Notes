# Notes for AWS Solutions Architect Associate Certification Exam.

This repository will serve to store my notes for the **SAA-C03 de AWS**.

At this point, I have already failed it twice, which is why I have decided to create these notes that will help me study it with the seriousness it deserves.

My sources will be:

**IMPORTANT: THIS IS NOT A COURSE, THESE ARE JUST NOTES FROM THE COURSES, SO I CAN READ THEM IN THE BUS OR IN THE BATHROOM (XD). I REALLY RECOMMEND TO TAKE THE COURSES I SPECIFIED ABOVE.**

_Will update this as time goes on_
