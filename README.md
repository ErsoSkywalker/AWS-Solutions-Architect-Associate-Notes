# Notes for AWS Solutions Architect Associate Certification Exam.

This repository will serve to store my notes for the **SAA-C03 de AWS**.

At this point, I have already failed it twice, which is why I have decided to create these notes that will help me study it with the seriousness it deserves.

My sources will be:
